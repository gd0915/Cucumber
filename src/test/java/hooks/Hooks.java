    Hooks is used to run before and after each SCENARIO
    i.g. If feature file has 2 scenario, Hooks will be run 2 times. It is based on the Scenario.
    To be able to run the Hooks class, we use 'glue' tag in Runner class, put "hooks" as parameter
    By putting specific tag like @After("@browser and not @headless") we can put a condition to run the Hooks class => Conditional hooks

/*
Hooks is just a Java class, but is a special class. It is running 'before' or especially 'after' each Scenario.
After method is usually used to capture screenshot.
Like a TestBase class.
Hooks is specific for Cucumber.
We can put the code that we want to run before and after each Scenario.
 */

/*
Why do we use Hooks class in our framework?
We use hooks class to generate the reports with screenshot.
My after method especially helpful to capture screenshot when a Scenario fails automatically.
What is in it?
It has Before and After methods. I have reports method to capture the screenshot
