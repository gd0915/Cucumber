JDBC NOTES:
1. JDBC is an API to work with databases
   JDBC = Java Database Connectivity

2. Add Database Utilities Class in utilities folder

3. Our application use postgresql server(Database)

   Add driver(dependency) for post gre sql database

<!-- https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.postgresql/postgresql -->
        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.postgresql</groupId>
            <artifactId>postgresql</artifactId>
            <version>42.5.0</version>
        </dependency>

* We use sql queries to retrieve data from the database either manual and also in automation.
* There are different databases like Oracle, Microsoft Mysql, postgresql..etc
* There are different tools to retrieve data from database and  we can use them for manual testing. postgresql, sql developer, etc...
* For automation we additionally use JDBC.


*  How to use JDBC
1. Connect Database
• connection=DriverManager.getConnection(“url”, “username”, “password”);

2.Send query and get data
• statement=connection.createStatement(ResultSet.TYPE_SCROLL_INSENSITIVE,
ResultSet.CONCUR_READ_ONLY);

3. Used the queries in the test cases for assertions
• resultSet = statement.executeQuery("SELECT * FROM Book;”);
• String expectedResult = resultSet.getString(“BookName”);
• Assert.assertEquals(expectedResult, actualResult);

4. Create feature file under jdbc folder
 *jdbc_read_data.feature

5. NOT MANDATORY - create runner class for only database features
package runners;
import io.cucumber.junit.Cucumber;
import io.cucumber.junit.CucumberOptions;
import org.junit.runner.RunWith;
@RunWith(Cucumber.class)
@CucumberOptions(
        plugin = {
                "pretty",
                "html:target/default-cucumber-reports.html",
                "json:target/json-reports/cucumber.json",
                "junit:target/xml-report/cucumber.xml",
                "rerun:target/failedRerun.txt"
        },
        monochrome=true,
        features = "./src/test/resources/features/jdbc",
        glue = {"stepdefinitions"},
        dryRun = false,
        tags = "@db_read"

)
public class DBRunners {
}

6. generate the step definitions and write the code
package stepdefinitions;
import io.cucumber.java.en.Given;
public class DatabaseStepDefinitions {
    @Given("user connects to the application database")
    public void user_connects_to_the_application_database() {

    }
}



************************* HOW TO USE JDBC ************************
          1. Connect Database
                         • connection=DriverManager.getConnection(“url”, “username”, “password”);
          2.Send query and get data
                         • statement=connection.createStatement(ResultSet.TYPE_SCROLL_INSENSITIVE,
                         ResultSet.CONCUR_READ_ONLY);
          3. Used the queries in the test cases for assertions
                         • resultSet = statement.executeQuery("SELECT * FROM Book;”);
                         • String expectedData = resultSet.getString(“BookName”);
                         • Assert.assertEquals(expectedData, actualData);

*********************** SCHEMA ************************************
=> Every Database has schema
=> The tables are connected with primary keys
=> Testers uses schema to right the queries to connect to the right tables and columns.


********************** DATABASE UTILITIES **************************
*   In our framework, we use Database Utilities Class.
=> This utilities class is in the utilities folder. The reason is to keep the test classes clean avoid repetition
=> This class has reusable methods, similar to Driver or Test Base class
=> For example, we have createConnection() method in this class. We can call this class whenever we need.


****************************

GMI Bank DatBase Url = "jdbc:postgresql://157.230.48.97:5432/gmibank_db";
==>> DataBase Type => jdbc:postgresql:
==>> Domain        => 157.230.48.97:5432
==>> DataBase name => gmibank_db

******************** HOW DID YOU DO DATABASE TESTING *****************

==>Why do you do database testing?
* To compare database and UI data
* For example, when a manager creates a customer from UI, is that customer information stored in the database.
* For example, when a customer service make a reservation for customer, does that information stored in the database.
* Reading the data and validation of that data that is entered from UI

  => Database testing is faster that UI testing.

  => We can check when I create a data in the database using JDBC, does that data shows up in the UI. This is not common.
     Example: Reading the data and validation of that data that is sent to the Database

***Real world scenarios:
 When user books a hotel from UI, does it appear in the database.
 When a user sign up, does the data goes to the database properly.
 When a user makes car reservation, does the reservation stored in the database.
